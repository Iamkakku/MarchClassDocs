Testing is a process- not a single activity

Verification - Just to make sure product is built as per requirement, Verification is whitebox testing- 
done by developers
Validation - Make sure product is built as per requirement and also test as end user
(w.r.to different user activities, performance, security, configuration, compatibility etc) ,
It is blackbox testing, It is done by QA group.

Whitebox Testing : Testing the functionality by knowing the design and code details, 
In whitebox testing we write code to test the code.
Generally develeopers do white box testing - unit testing.

public int noOfSubjects(String courseName){

if(courseName=="QA"){
return 10;
}else if(courseName=="UI"){
return 15;
}
}

@Test
public void testNoOfSubjects(){
  actual = noOfSubjects("QA");
  expected = 10;
  if(actual == expected){
   log(working as exepected);
  }else{
   log(Test fail - results do not match);
  }

}


Blackbox Testing :  Testing the functionality by not knowing the design and code details. 
Done by Qa group.


TestCases - Can be written in excel/word doc/Rally/JIRA/Wiki links


What testcase consist of:
Date, AuthorName, company,
TestCaseId
Description
priority
Precondition
TestSteps
TestData
expected
actual
result


Qa should do basic debugging before raising a defect:
I would check browser dev tools(by right click and inspect or directly press F12) console, network tabs
to figure out any client side logs in console, API issue in network tab.
If I could not find the reason by dev tools I would further check server logs(by connecting to unix server machine).

Once we do basic debugging we would atleast know whether the issue is in client side, API side, server side logic
or in DataBase or with deployment.

Retesting - Test the defect that is fixed to make sure if it is properly fixed.

RegressionTesting- After a defect fix or enhancement we try to test already tested functionalities
to make sure that new enhancement or defect fix did not break the existing things.

SmokeTesting - Crtical functionality which when fails - you cannot proceed with any further testing
FunctionaltyTesting - All scenarios as per the requirement.
RegressionTesting - SuperSet of smoke test cases and subset of functionality test cases.

unit testing

IntegrationTesting:
1.SystemIntegrationTesting
2.ComponentIntegrationTesting

we have 3 diff approaches:
BigBang
TopDown
BottomUP

SystemTesting
UserAcceptanceTesting
ProductionValidation/Testing

In SIT and UAT - we will have 
SmokeTesting
RegressionTesting

TDD- Test Driven Development
login - 10 testcases - 10 unit test methods - tests are driving the develepment.
BDD - Behaviour driven development

Some of popular behaviour driven development frameworks are Cucumber, Jasmine etc...

SystemTesting:
FunctionalTesting
PerformanceTesting - concurrent users to application
- what do we analyze in performance testing - 
ResponseTime(time to get complete response), 
Latency(time to get first byte of response), 
Throughput(no of requests served per unit time)
Always for good peformance - response time and latency should be less and throughput should be more.

Load testing-
Stress testing- try to find out breaking point for application
Volume testing- testing with more volume data in database

Usability
- look and feel
- fonta, colors, size of fonts, images
- broken links 
- scrolling
- pagination
- select, radio, navigations
- responsive web design
